# Lanczos-Algorithm-
The Lanczos algorithm is an iterative method used to compute a few eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large sparse symmetric matrices. It creates an orthonormal basis for a Krylov subspace, resulting in a small tridiagonal matrix with eigenvalues that approximate the original matrix.
